# Complex-Functions
An [interactive](https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Complex-Functions.html) for visualizing complex functions based on a [3Blue1Brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0NjbwqlYw).
Also, Riemann Zeta Function was estimated using Euler Maclaurin Summation. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/prajwalsouza/Complex-Functions/blob/master/zetaEMS.html). It is based on the [work](https://math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m56s13/public_html/Nguyen_proj.pdf) of Hanh Nguyen.
